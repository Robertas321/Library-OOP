# üìö Library Management System ‚Äì Coursework Report
# _1. Introduction_
_What is this application?_
This application is a simple console-based Library Management System written in Python. It allows users to view available books and managers to add or remove books from the system.

_How to run the program?_
Make sure Python is installed on your machine, then run the main file:
`python main.py`

_üßë‚Äçüíª How to use the program?_
On launch, the user enters their name and chooses a role:

`1` for `Manager` (with `password`), `2` for regular `User`

Depending on the role, different actions will be shown:

`User`: View books; Exit.

`Manager`: Add a book; View books; Remove a book; Exit

# ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Body / Analysis
‚úÖ Functional Requirements & Implementation

‚û§ Object-Oriented Programming

_Encapsulation_: `Book` class keeps attributes private using double underscores (`__title`, `__author`):
```python
class Book(LibraryItem):
    def __init__(self, title, author, isbn):
        self.__title = title
        self.__author = author
        self.__isbn = isbn
```
_Inheritance & Polymorphism_: `Manager` inherits from `User` and overrides the `show_actions()` method:
```python
class Manager(User):
    def show_actions(self):
        print("\nHi, Manager! Choose your action:")
        print("1. Add a Book")
        print("2. View Books")
        print("3. Remove a Book")
        print("4. Exit")
```

_Abstraction_: `LibraryItem` is an abstract base class (`ABC`) using `@abstractmethod`.
```python
class Book(LibraryItem):
```
‚û§ Factory Method Pattern

The `UserFactory` class uses the Factory Method pattern to create either a `User` or a `Manager` based on input:
```python
class UserFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_user(name, role_input, password=None):
        if role_input == '1' and password == "admin123":
            return Manager(name)
        return User(name)
```
‚û§ Composition implementation

Class `Library` "Owns" a list of `Book` objects. These objects do not exist independently outside of `Library`.
When you remove or save books, it's always done through `Library`:
```python
class Library:
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = []
```
‚û§ File Handling (State Persistence)

Books are stored in a file (books.csv), which simulates persistent state:
```python
def save_books(self, filename="books.csv"):
    with open(filename, 'w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerows(book.to_list() for book in self.books)
```
‚û§ Testing

`test_library.py` uses `unittest` extentions to test core functionalities from `library.py` such as:
`add_book`, `remove_book`, `load_book` methods, it simulates incorrect occurances with incorrrect inputs:
```python
class TestLibrary(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_remove_book_invalid_index(self):
        self.library.remove_book(99)
        self.assertEqual(len(self.library.books), 1)
```
Output:
```cmd
‚ùå Invalid index. No book removed.
```
# ‚úÖ Results
- Implemented a role-based library system where managers can add or remove books and users can only view them.
- Faced challenges with enforcing encapsulation and ensuring private methods weren‚Äôt misused by regular users.
- Encountered difficulties with displaying book information properly and formatting removal messages, but resolved them by refining the __str__ method.
- Successfully integrated file handling for persistent book storage using CSV files, with the ability to load and save books dynamically.
- Learned how to apply key OOP concepts (abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism) in a real-world scenario.
- The code has troubles in the unit testing area, when methods are called in `test_library.py` file they trigger `save_books` method which makes has a
connection to the real `books.csv` file, therefore it gets wiped clean after the programme is run. I was unable fix this issue yet.

  
# üßæ Conclusions
This coursework demonstrated a practical understanding of object-oriented programming in Python by building a functional library management system. The final program supports user verification, book storage, and role-based permissions. It effectively uses abstraction and inheritance to differentiate user roles, and encapsulation to protect sensitive methods. Future prospects include adding user registration via email, search functionality, UI integration for better usability, and perhaps a registry system.
